Spring Security on Servicemix Tests
=================================================

A project with my tests for studing if Spring Security can work on ServiceMix/Karaf

Please note building this project require the "parent" from this other project of mine: https://github.com/cristcost/sensormix/tree/master/parent

The code may be not rational (the html page says about a 'GWT' example, but there is no GWT at all in this project!), but don't mind, it is due to copy and paste from other code.

There are two users: "admin" and "user", both with password "123".

I've build the example progressively, adding one spring security features step by step. You can check the git tags to see the most relevant steps I've achieved. 

If you are interested in the example, feel free to open issues and I'll be glad to help or refine the examples for you to use it.
